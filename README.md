This repo provides an overview of our comprehensive CI/CD deployment cycle, ensuring meticulous version control for each microservice. MicroK8s serves as the deployment platform, with Jenkins and ArgoCD seamlessly orchestrating tasks such as Docker image creation and manifest pushing to MicroK8s. To optimise time utilisation, a multibranch pipeline is employed for code building across different branches in jenkins. Image storage is centralised in Harbor, while Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki collectively handle logging and metrics, offering insights into both cluster and microservices performance. Security is enhanced using sealed secrets to encrypt GitHub-held secrets. For version management, ArgoCD facilitates seamless rollbacks and forwards, contributing to a robust and efficient deployment strategy.
