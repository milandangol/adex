## About the Application

This app suggests what you can do on a date with your partner.
It takes a single date input and suggests what you can do on a date.

At the moment, the application does not have a database. It will in the future. Currently, the data comes from a json data dump.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The app is not perfect. A lot of things can be improved. It is simply for demo purposes, however, shoot me an [email](egbunaoluebube@gmail.com) if you find something you think can be better.
